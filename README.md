# Covid_Cases_Chart
This program will chart the top 'x' countries with the most COVID-19 cases. The user will enter an integer.

You can run the program here at my trinket: https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/3e2d25b054 

The zip in the repository contains only "main.py"

The data the program plots is from: " https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pomber/covid19/master/docs/timeseries.json ". Thank you for that!

URL retrived with 'urllib.request' and data charted with 'pygal' due to Trinket enviorment
