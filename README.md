# Covid_Cases_Chart
This program will chart the top 'x' countries with the most COVID-19 cases. The user will enter an integer.

The data the program plots is from: " https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pomber/covid19/master/docs/timeseries.json ". Thank you for that!
Retrived with urllib.request


The program uses Pygal to chart the data.
